Intro
=====
Google Photos Sync downloads all photos and videos the user has uploaded to 
Google Photos. It also organizes the media in the local file system using 
album information. Additional Google Photos 'Creations' such as 
animations, panoramas, movies, effects and collages are also backed up.

This software is read only and never modifies your cloud library in any way,
so there is no risk of damaging your data.
